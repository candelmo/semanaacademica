The objective of this work is to delineate, from a literature review, the results are compared with the maturity models of Testing Processes (TMMi, TPI (Next) and MPT.br). The systemic basis of literature based on data available on the web. The results are a synthesis of the three types of test maturity investigated, being that they are part of the academic model and the comparisons are characteristic of the models. In conclusion there are many maturity models of tests proposed in the literature, with TMMi and TPI being the most usable at an international level, and MPT.br the model in the Brazilian context.

The seven steps of the literature review using meta-analytical approach were followed, and initially, were identified and selected top journals of studied area. Collection data showed that despite the quantitative growth of articles on this subject in recent years, there is still need for experiments on functional measurement software, considering the total quantitative down these surveys. In addition, this study demonstrated that the identified items are not part of the main most cited journals, which can be inferred as a gap on this subject. Surveyed bases analysis identified articles and most cited authors and gaps between countries using more and more, the size measurement metrics and those who do little or no research on subject.

Method: Bibliometrics and systematic review methodologies were used. The search process was performed in the Web of Science and SPELL databases and resulted in the selection of 23 articles within the defined scope, among 82 studies. The selected studies were analyzed through descriptive statistics, Descending Hierarchical Classification (DHC) and Corresponding Factor Analysis (CFA). Results: The results point to recent interest in measuring performance in the hightech market, especially in emerging markets such as Taiwan and China, with the use of multidimensional indicators of a financial and non-financial nature. Through the DHC and CFA analyses, we have been able to observe four Classes - 'Internal Abilities', 'Alliances', 'Downstream Focus' and 'Upstream Focus' - and these dominant areas indicate the interest associated with market performance in the high-te},

Abstract = {Software Engineering (SE) is constituted by phenomena that are built socially and culturally, not technically. Research conducted in this area should comprehend such phenomena. However, qualitative methods, suited for this kind of research, are not commonly used in SE. Despite this fact, a recent growth in the number of qualitative studies in the area has been observed, particularly using Grounded Theory (GT). Grounded Theory is based on a set of systematic procedures of collecting and analyzing data in order to generate, elaborate and validate substantive theories on socially phenomena. In this context, this work aimed at performing a systematic literature review for characterizing studies on SE that used Grounded Theory. Results show an increase in the number of SE studies using GT, particularly in research involving human behavior in projects that use agile methods or are developed in a distributed way.

Patients with MDD can show an imbalance in cortisol levels, which can be restored with the remission of symptoms. Physical exercise training has been used as a tool to promote changes in cortisol levels in healthy individuals. However, it is unknown if exercise can produce the same results in individuals with MDD. Objective: To review evidence of cortisol changes after exercise training in individuals with MDD. Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. Random effects meta-analysis was performed and standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size was calculated. Analyses of forest and funnel plots was conducted using Stata v.11.0 software.

The evolution of these methods and the adoption of new practices have been constant in areas related to software engineering. Among them stand out agile methods, used in projects that search alternatives to make production more efficient, economical, and of quality.

To identify other relationships and strategic contributions of these schools to improve the agile paradigm this study presents a systematic review of the literature, analyzing papers that unite the themes. The results showed that the topic is current and globally discussed, emphasizing the importance of knowledge management to support the deployment of agile processes.

Its development was done through a systematic review process, supported by Bibliometrics and Scientometrics methods and techniques, where the Critical Success Factors (CSF) of ICT Governance projects and the principles of the Agile Manifesto were analyzed. Next, through an inductive approach, focused on the convergence between the concepts involved, it was analyzed how agile principles could help to minimize the gap between ICT and business. Evidences of their occurrence were taken through a Conceptual Survey Research. As a result, the foundations and concepts of Agile Governance in ICT were defined and, finally, the development of a reference model was proposed as a future work. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {Understand (potential) user's desires and needs are challenges for Requirements Engineering and Interaction Design. Both, Requirements Engineering and Interaction Design, have tools to help the requirements engineer and interaction designer to identify and specify desires and needs, like the SPIDe (Semio-Participatory Interaction Design). However, it is not yet known whether SPIDe enables engineering software requirements. In this sense, this paper presents results of a systematic review on the use of SPIDe techniques applied to Requirements Engineering. The results show that two techniques that make up the SPIDE have been used in Requirements Engineering. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {With the raise of computer systems' complexity, greater number of modules, technologies involved and functionalities, monitoring and keeping up with such systems in real time has become an indispensable task, given the fact that the quality of production software impacts directly on decision making and risk management by organizations. Knowing what to observe, which metrics are being more used for runtime software monitoring is an essential part of this context. Therefore, this article presents a systematic mapping regarding the monitoring mechanisms and raises a few research questions. Listing of most used approaches and metrics for runtime legacy systems monitoring. The survey of monitoring metrics allow a better approach for runtime legacy systems comprehension, allowing more suitable strategies for the continuity of such systems.

Abstract = {E-commerce services represent an important and attractive economic sector. Among other factors, the success of this type of service is linked to the satisfaction of its users. Understanding the aspects related to satisfaction is fundamental to establish the quality of these services. The non-functional requirement of usability plays an important role in software quality, and may be related to user satisfaction. With this in view, this research seeks to assess whether usability influences consumer satisfaction of e-commerce systems. For this, a Systematic Literature Review was conducted, which selected primary studies that statistically correlated usability and user satisfaction. The results point out a relationship between perceived usability in e-commerce systems and the satisfaction of its users. In addition, the data obtained in the RSL show that the usability influences the purchase intention and the loyalty of the consumers. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
